INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

❌ NEEDS WORK: Significant differences between PanelBox and R.
   Implementations should be reviewed and corrected.

NOTES:
- Some tests use approximations in R (e.g., Modified Wald uses Bartlett test)
- Small numerical differences (<5%) are expected due to algorithm differences
- P-value differences <0.01 are considered acceptable
