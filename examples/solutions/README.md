# Tutorial Exercise Solutions

This directory contains complete solutions to exercises in the tutorial notebooks.

## Structure

Solutions are organized by module, mirroring the tutorial structure:

```
solutions/
├── 01_fundamentals/
│   ├── 01_introduction_solutions.ipynb
│   ├── 02_formulas_solutions.ipynb
│   ├── 03_estimation_solutions.ipynb
│   └── 04_spatial_solutions.ipynb
├── 02_classical_estimators/
├── 03_gmm_dynamic/
├── 04_spatial_models/
└── 05_advanced/
```

## Usage Guidelines

### For Self-Study
1. Attempt exercises in the main tutorial notebooks first
2. Only consult solutions after genuine effort
3. Use solutions to verify your approach, not just the answer
4. If your solution differs, try to understand why both work (or don't)

### For Instructors
These solution notebooks can be:
- Used as answer keys for grading
- Shared with students after assignment deadlines
- Modified for your specific course needs

**Recommendation**: Do not distribute solutions before students complete exercises.

## Solution Format

Each solution notebook includes:
- Complete, executable code for all exercises
- Detailed explanations of the approach
- Discussion of alternative methods
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Additional notes for deeper understanding

## Contributing

If you find errors in solutions or have better approaches:
1. Open an issue describing the problem
2. Submit a pull request with corrections
3. Provide justification for alternative solutions
