    "\n",
    "## Why Spatial Econometrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tobler's First Law of Geography (1970)\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This fundamental principle of geography has profound implications for econometric analysis. When we analyze cross-sectional or panel data that has a spatial dimension (e.g., countries, states, counties, cities), we often find that observations are **not independent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Examples of Spatial Dependence\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial dependence matters in many economic phenomena:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regional Economic Growth**: Technological spillovers and knowledge diffusion across neighboring regions\n",
    "2. **Housing Prices**: Neighborhood effects and local amenities affect nearby property values\n",
    "3. **Crime Rates**: Criminal activity often exhibits spatial diffusion patterns\n",
    "4. **Disease Spread**: Epidemics follow geographic contagion processes\n",
    "5. **Technology Adoption**: Firms imitate nearby competitors' innovations\n",
    "6. **Agricultural Productivity**: Pest infestations and weather shocks cross borders\n",
    "7. **Environmental Quality**: Air and water pollution don't respect political boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Standard Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard econometric methods (like OLS) assume observations are independent:**\n",
    "- E(εᵢεⱼ) = 0 for all i ≠ j\n",
    "- This assumption is **violated** when spatial correlation exists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consequences of ignoring spatial dependence:**\n",
    "1. **Biased parameter estimates** (if spatial lag of y is omitted)\n",
    "2. **Inefficient estimates** (if spatial correlation in errors)\n",
    "3. **Incorrect standard errors** (usually underestimated)\n",
    "4. **Invalid hypothesis tests** (t-statistics and F-statistics are wrong)\n",
    "5. **Wrong policy conclusions** (incorrect inference about causal effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution:** Spatial econometric models that explicitly account for geographic relationships between observations."

    "\n",
    "1. **Positive Spatial Autocorrelation** (most common):\n",
    "   - High values tend to be located near other high values\n",
    "   - Low values tend to be located near other low values\n",
    "   - Results in **clustering** or **agglomeration**\n",
    "   - Example: Rich neighborhoods near rich neighborhoods\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Negative Spatial Autocorrelation** (rare):\n",
    "   - High values tend to be located near low values\n",
    "   - Results in a **checkerboard pattern**\n",
    "   - Example: Competitive retail locations avoiding clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Spatial Autocorrelation** (random):\n",
    "   - No systematic spatial pattern\n",
    "   - Values are randomly distributed across space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference from Temporal Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Temporal Autocorrelation | Spatial Autocorrelation |\n",
    "|---------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| **Direction** | One-directional (past → present → future) | Multidirectional (all neighbors) |\n",
    "| **Natural ordering** | Yes (time flows forward) | No (no natural ordering of space) |\n",
    "| **Neighbor structure** | Fixed (t-1, t-2, etc.) | Must be specified (who is a neighbor?) |\n",
    "| **Feedback loops** | Limited | Strong (simultaneous) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Spatial Autocorrelation Occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spillover effects**: Economic activities in one region affect neighbors\n",
    "2. **Common shocks**: Nearby regions experience similar unobserved shocks\n",
    "3. **Measurement error**: Spatial data often uses arbitrary boundaries\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Fundamental Tool: Spatial Weight Matrix W\n",
    "\n",
    "The **spatial weight matrix W** is the foundation of all spatial econometric models. It encodes our assumptions about which units influence each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is W?\n",
    "\n",
    "W is an N×N matrix defining neighborhood relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **wᵢⱼ > 0** if units i and j are neighbors\n",
    "- **wᵢⱼ = 0** if units i and j are not neighbors\n",
    "- **wᵢᵢ = 0** (diagonal elements = 0, unit is not its own neighbor)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role in Spatial Models\n",
    "\n",
    "W operationalizes the concept of \"nearness\" or \"connectivity\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wy**: Spatial lag (weighted average of neighbors' y values)\n",
    "- **WX**: Spatial lag of explanatory variables\n",
    "- **Wε**: Spatially lagged errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: W is **specified**, not estimated. We choose W based on:\n",
    "1. Geographic proximity (contiguity, distance)\n",
    "2. Economic linkages (trade, migration)\n",
    "3. Social networks (kinship, institutional ties)\n",
    "4. Theoretical considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preview of W Types (Full Tutorial in Notebook 02)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contiguity-Based**:\n",
    "   - **Queen**: Neighbors if share border OR vertex (corner)\n",
    "   - **Rook**: Neighbors if share border (not corner)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distance-Based**:\n",
    "   - **Inverse distance**: wᵢⱼ = 1/dᵢⱼ or 1/dᵢⱼ²\n",
    "   - **Distance threshold**: wᵢⱼ = 1 if dᵢⱼ < d*, else 0\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **k-Nearest Neighbors**:\n",
    "   - **k-NN**: Each unit has exactly k neighbors (closest ones)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Economic/Social**:\n",
    "   - **Trade flows**: wᵢⱼ = trade volume between i and j\n",
    "   - **Migration**: wᵢⱼ = migration flows\n",
    "   - **Network**: Based on institutional or social connections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Row Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, W is **row-normalized**: Each row sums to 1.\n",

    "- **After**: wᵢⱼ = 1/#{neighbors of i} if neighbor, 0 otherwise\n",

    "- Choose W based on theory and data structure\n",
    "- Test sensitivity to different W specifications\n",
    "- Row-normalize W for interpretability\n",

    "### Step 4: Model Selection\n",
    "- If spatial lag significant → **Spatial Lag Model (SAR)**\n",
    "- If spatial error significant → **Spatial Error Model (SEM)**\n",
    "- If both → **Spatial Durbin Model (SDM)**\n",
    "- Use specification tests (LM tests, LR tests)\n",

    "### Step 5: Estimation\n",
    "- Estimate chosen model (ML or GMM)\n",
    "- Check convergence and diagnostics\n",
    "- Compute robust standard errors if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Interpretation\n",
    "- Compute **marginal effects** (direct, indirect, total)\n",
    "- Interpret spillover effects\n",
    "- Visualize spatial effects on map\n",
