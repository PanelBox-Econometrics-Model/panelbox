RESEARCH QUESTION:
  How do R&D subsidies affect firm innovation (patent output)?

DATA:
  - 500 firms over 8 years (4,000 observations)
  - Outcome: Patent applications (count data)
  - Panel structure: 2012-2019

METHODOLOGY:
  - Negative Binomial regression (accounts for overdispersion)
  - Multiple specifications with fixed effects
  - Heterogeneity analysis (interactions)
  - Robustness checks

KEY FINDINGS:

1. SUBSIDY EFFECT (Main Result):
   → R&D subsidies are associated with +22.37% change in patent output
   → Effect is statistically significant
   → Evidence supports additionality hypothesis

2. R&D INTENSITY:
   → Strong positive effect on patents
   → Key driver of innovation output

3. FIRM SIZE:
   → Larger firms produce more patents
   → Subsidy effects may vary by size (heterogeneity)

4. ROBUSTNESS:
   → Results stable across specifications
   → Not driven by outliers
   → Some industry heterogeneity

POLICY IMPLICATIONS:

1. PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS:
   → Subsidies appear to stimulate innovation
   → Cost-benefit analysis recommended

2. TARGETING:
   → Focus on firms with high R&D capacity
   → Consider industry-specific programs
   → Monitor for displacement effects

3. PROGRAM DESIGN:
   → Effects heterogeneous - one-size-fits-all may be inefficient
   → Consider graduated subsidy levels

LIMITATIONS:

1. Causality: Observational data - selection bias possible
2. Patents: Imperfect measure of innovation
3. Time horizon: May miss long-run effects
4. General equilibrium: Spillovers not modeled

FUTURE RESEARCH:

1. Instrumental variables for subsidy assignment
2. Longer time horizon (lagged effects)
3. Alternative innovation metrics (citations, products)
4. Spillover effects on competitors
5. Cost-effectiveness analysis
