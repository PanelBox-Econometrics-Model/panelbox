DATA GENERATION PROCESS:
========================
The data is generated via a Negative Binomial (NB2) process:

  log(mu_it) = beta_0 + beta_1 * log(rd_spending) + beta_2 * log(employees)
               + beta_3 * firm_age + beta_4 * tech_sector
               + beta_5 * public_funding + beta_6 * international
               + alpha_i

  Y_it ~ NB2(mu_it, alpha = 1.8)

Where alpha_i ~ N(0, 0.5) is an unobserved firm-level random effect.

True parameter values:
  beta_0 (intercept)     =  0.20
  beta_1 (log R&D)       =  0.35
  beta_2 (log employees) =  0.20
  beta_3 (firm age)      = -0.005
  beta_4 (tech sector)   =  0.50
  beta_5 (public funding)=  0.30
  beta_6 (international) =  0.20
  alpha (NB dispersion)  =  1.80

NOTES:
======
- Severe overdispersion (Var/Mean ≈ 18), Negative Binomial strongly preferred
- R&D spending has strong positive relationship with patents
- Tech sector firms show higher innovation rates
- Public funding effect boosts patenting output
- Firm size shows positive but smaller effect
- No missing values
- Panel is balanced (all firms observed for 5 years)
- Random seed: 42

DISTRIBUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS:
================================
- High proportion of zeros (~31%)
- Long right tail (max ~160 patents)
- Clear evidence against Poisson equidispersion
- Overdispersion driven by both NB process and unobserved heterogeneity

SUGGESTED ANALYSIS:
==================
Main specification:
  patents ~ log(rd_spending) + log(employees) + firm_age + tech_sector +
            public_funding + international

Key tests:
  1. Overdispersion test (reject Poisson)
  2. Likelihood ratio test NB vs Poisson
  3. Compare coefficients and standard errors
  4. Rootogram visualization

Interpretation:
  - Coefficients as incidence rate ratios (IRRs)
  - Marginal effects
  - Effect of doubling R&D spending
  - Economic significance of tech sector premium

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND:
=======================
Based on knowledge production function literature:
- Patents = f(R&D, firm characteristics, spillovers)
- Knowledge accumulation is nonlinear
- Unobserved heterogeneity in innovation capacity
- Negative Binomial captures firm-level heterogeneity

KEY EMPIRICAL PATTERNS:
=======================
1. R&D elasticity ≈ 0.35 (log specification)
2. Size elasticity ≈ 0.20
3. Tech sector premium ≈ 65% (exp(0.50) - 1)
4. Public funding increases patents by ~35%
5. Overdispersion parameter alpha ≈ 1.8 (highly significant)

COMPARISON WITH POISSON:
========================
- Poisson severely underestimates standard errors
- Poisson may show spurious significance for weak predictors
- Negative Binomial has much lower AIC/BIC
- LR test strongly rejects Poisson

EXTENSIONS SUGGESTED:
=====================
- Zero-inflated models (~31% zeros may include structural zeros)
- Fixed effects for firm heterogeneity (see Tutorial 03)
- Dynamic models with lagged patents
- Spatial spillovers between firms in same region
