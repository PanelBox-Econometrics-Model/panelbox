NOTES:
======
- Balanced panel: all 150 cities observed for all 10 years
- Strong within-city variation suitable for Fixed Effects
- Between-city variation for Random Effects comparison
- No missing values
- Time-varying and time-invariant covariates present
- Overdispersion present but moderate

PANEL STRUCTURE:
================
- Within variation: Crime rates change over time within cities
- Between variation: Systematic differences between cities
- Total variation: Combined within and between
- Hausman test will discriminate FE vs RE

FIXED EFFECTS CONSIDERATIONS:
==============================
- Controls for unobserved city-specific effects (e.g., culture, geography)
- Time-invariant variables (region) absorbed by FE
- Identifies effect from within-city changes
- Assumes strict exogeneity conditional on fixed effects

RANDOM EFFECTS CONSIDERATIONS:
===============================
- More efficient if RE assumptions hold
- Allows estimation of time-invariant effects
- Requires uncorrelated effects assumption
- Generally rejected by Hausman test for this data

SUGGESTED ANALYSIS:
==================
Main specifications:

1. Pooled Poisson (baseline):
   crimes ~ police_per_capita + unemployment + poverty_rate +
            median_income + young_male_pct + high_school_pct +
            region + metro_area

2. Fixed Effects Poisson:
   crimes ~ police_per_capita + unemployment + poverty_rate +
            median_income + young_male_pct + high_school_pct
   (region and metro_area dropped - time invariant)

3. Random Effects Poisson:
   crimes ~ police_per_capita + unemployment + poverty_rate +
            median_income + young_male_pct + high_school_pct +
            region + metro_area

Key tests:
  1. Hausman specification test (FE vs RE)
  2. Test for presence of fixed effects
  3. Overdispersion test
  4. Serial correlation in residuals

Interpretation:
  - Police effect: elasticity or semi-elasticity
  - Economic determinants: unemployment, poverty, income
  - Demographic composition effects
  - Regional differences (RE only)

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK:
======================
Based on economic theory of crime (Becker 1968, Ehrlich 1973):
- Crime = f(expected benefits, expected costs, opportunities)
- Police increase expected costs (deterrence)
- Unemployment/poverty affect benefits
- Demographics affect propensity

KEY EMPIRICAL PATTERNS:
=======================
1. Police elasticity ≈ -0.4 (10% more police → 4% fewer crimes)
2. Unemployment elasticity ≈ 0.3 (procyclical crime)
3. Young males effect is strong (1 pp increase → 3% more crime)
4. Within variation explains 60% of total variation
5. Hausman test strongly rejects RE (p < 0.001)

POOLED VS FE VS RE COMPARISON:
===============================
- Pooled: Overestimates police effect (omitted variable bias)
- FE: Consistent estimates under strict exogeneity
- RE: Biased due to correlation with city effects
- FE standard errors 40% larger than pooled (controls for heterogeneity)

TIME EFFECTS:
=============
- Consider adding year fixed effects for macro trends
- Crime fell nationally 2013-2019, rose 2020-2022
- COVID-19 disruption in 2020-2021
- Time FE controls for national trends

IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY:
========================
Fixed Effects identification:
- Exploit within-city variation in police hiring
- Compare same city before/after policy changes
- Difference out time-invariant confounders
- Assumes no time-varying omitted variables

Threats to identification:
- Reverse causality (crime → police hiring)
- Time-varying confounders (e.g., drug epidemics)
- Measurement error in crime reporting
- Strategic timing of police hiring

EXTENSIONS SUGGESTED:
=====================
- Dynamic models with lagged crime (persistence)
- Spatial models (crime spillovers to neighboring cities)
- Negative Binomial FE for overdispersion
- IV estimation for police endogeneity
- Two-way fixed effects (city + year)
