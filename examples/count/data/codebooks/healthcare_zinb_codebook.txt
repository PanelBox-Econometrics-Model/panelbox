   % with chronic: ~30%
   Role: Count model covariate (intensity driver)

6. insurance

   0 = Uninsured
   1 = Insured
   % insured: ~65%
   Role: Inflation model covariate (access barrier)

   Type: Float (1-80)
   Description: Distance to nearest clinic (km)
   Mean: ~15 km
   SD: ~14.6 km
   Units: Kilometers
   Role: Inflation model covariate (access barrier)

8. urban
   Type: Binary (0/1)
   Description: Urban residence
   0 = Rural
   1 = Urban
   % urban: ~61%
   Role: Inflation model covariate (access facilitator)

NOTES:
======
- ~62% zeros: Mix of structural and sampling zeros
- Structural zeros: "Never user" group (no insurance, far from clinic)
- Sampling zeros: "Potential users" with zero visits in observation period
- Overdispersion present even among non-zero counts (Var/Mean ~2.06)
- Two distinct processes: participation and frequency

ZERO-INFLATION STRUCTURE:
=========================
Two latent groups:

1. "Structural zeros" (never-users): ~55%
   Characteristics:
   - No insurance, live far from clinics, rural
   - Fundamentally different population
   - Will not use healthcare regardless of health need

2. "Potential users" (count process): ~45%
   Characteristics:
   - Have insurance and access
   - May have zero visits by chance (sampling zeros)
   - Visits follow Poisson/Negative Binomial distribution

Observed zeros = Structural zeros + Sampling zeros from potential users

KEY EMPIRICAL PATTERNS:
=======================

Inflation equation (logit coefficients):
- Insurance:    -1.41 (insured less likely to be structural zero)
- Distance:     +0.04 per km (farther --> more likely structural zero)
- Urban:        -0.69 (urban less likely to be structural zero)

Count equation (coefficients):
- Age:          +0.013 per year (older visit more, among users)
- Income:       -0.003 per $1K (small negative effect)
- Chronic:      +0.622 (chronic condition increases visits ~86%)

Overdispersion parameter (ZINB):
- alpha = 0.316 (mild overdispersion, ZINB preferred over ZIP)

ZERO RATES BY SUBGROUP:
========================
- No insurance: ~79% zeros
- Has insurance: ~53% zeros
- Rural: ~70% zeros
- Urban: ~57% zeros
- No chronic: ~65% zeros
- Has chronic: ~57% zeros

MODEL COMPARISON:
=================
Model          | Log-Lik   | AIC      | BIC      | Best?
---------------|-----------|----------|----------|------
Poisson        | -6,215    | 12,438   | 12,462   | No
Neg Binomial   | -5,753    | 11,517   | 11,547   | No
ZIP            | -4,193    | 8,401    | 8,449    | No
ZINB           | -4,071    | 8,160    | 8,214    | Yes

ZINB is preferred model (Vuong test V=25.70, p < 0.001)

SUGGESTED ANALYSIS:
==================
Model progression:
1. Poisson (baseline, inadequate for excess zeros)
2. Negative Binomial (handles overdispersion, not zeros)
3. ZIP (handles zeros, but equidispersion in count part)
4. ZINB (handles both -- best fit)

Key specification:
- Count covariates (X): age, income, chronic_condition
- Inflation covariates (Z): insurance, distance_clinic, urban
- Different covariates for participation vs intensity

POLICY APPLICATIONS:
====================
1. Insurance expansion: Reduces structural zeros by ~10.5 pp
   - Universal insurance would increase expected visits by ~24%
2. Access improvement: Reducing distance barriers
   - Mainly affects participation margin
3. Chronic disease management:
   - Affects intensity margin among users
