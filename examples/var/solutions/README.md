# Solutions

## Purpose

This directory contains complete solutions for all exercises in the tutorial notebooks 01-07.

## Usage

1. **Complete the exercises first** in the corresponding tutorial notebook.
2. Compare your solutions with these reference implementations.
3. Each solution notebook mirrors the structure of its tutorial counterpart.
