# Finance Panel — Codebook

## Overview
- **Source**: Synthetic data generated by PanelBox (inspired by MSCI and Bloomberg indices)
- **Panel dimensions**: N = 50 countries, T = 100 periods
- **Time coverage**: Period 1 to 100
- **Total observations**: 5,000

## Variables

| Variable | Type | Unit | Description | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------------|-------|
| country | str | — | Country ISO-3 code | Primary key (with time). 50 countries. |
| time | int | — | Time period (1 to 100) | Primary key (with country) |
| stock_return | float | % | Stock market return | mean ≈ 0.5, std ≈ 3.0. Highest volatility. |
| bond_return | float | % | Government bond return | mean ≈ 0.3, std ≈ 1.5. Lower volatility. |
| fx_return | float | % | Currency return vs USD | mean ≈ 0.0, std ≈ 2.0. Zero mean (efficient markets). |
| commodity_return | float | % | Commodity index return | mean ≈ 0.2, std ≈ 2.5. Moderate volatility. |

## Economic Relationships (DGP)

The data is generated from a VAR(1) process with cross-asset correlations:

1. **Stock-Bond negative correlation** (-0.20): Flight-to-quality effect — negative stock shocks drive positive bond returns.
2. **Stock-FX positive correlation** (+0.15): Risk-on/risk-off dynamics — strong equity markets associated with currency appreciation.
3. **Low autocorrelation**: Asset returns have weak persistence (diagonal ≈ 0.05-0.10), consistent with near-efficient markets.
4. **Country risk premia**: Fixed effects capture cross-country differences in expected returns.

**Note**: Returns are stationary by construction — no unit root issues. This dataset is ideal for FEVD analysis to understand which shocks dominate asset return variance.

## Country List

50 countries spanning developed and emerging markets across all major regions.

## Data Generation

Generated using `utils/data_generators.py::generate_finance_panel()`.
See `00_ESTRUTURA.md` Section 2.4 for complete DGP details.

## Usage Example

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('../data/finance_panel.csv')
print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")
print(f"Countries: {df['country'].nunique()}")
```
