# Macro Panel — Codebook

## Overview
- **Source**: Synthetic data generated by PanelBox (inspired by IMF World Economic Outlook)
- **Panel dimensions**: N = 30 countries, T = 40 quarters
- **Time coverage**: 2010-Q1 to 2019-Q4
- **Total observations**: 1,200

## Variables

| Variable | Type | Unit | Description | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------------|-------|
| country | str | — | Country ISO-3 code | Primary key (with quarter). Mix of developed and emerging economies. |
| quarter | str | — | Quarter in "YYYY-QN" format | Primary key (with country). 40 quarters. |
| gdp_growth | float | % annualized | Real GDP growth rate | mean ≈ 2.0, std ≈ 1.5. Responds negatively to interest rate lags. |
| inflation | float | % annualized | CPI inflation rate | mean ≈ 3.0, std ≈ 2.0. Responds positively to GDP growth lags. |
| interest_rate | float | % | Policy interest rate | mean ≈ 4.0, std ≈ 2.5, ≥ 0. Follows Taylor rule (responds to inflation). |
| unemployment | float | % | Unemployment rate | mean ≈ 7.0, std ≈ 3.0, ≥ 0. Follows Okun's law (responds negatively to GDP). |
| exchange_rate | float | index (100=base) | Real effective exchange rate | mean ≈ 100, std ≈ 15. Responds to interest rate via UIP. |

## Economic Relationships (DGP)

The data is generated from a VAR(2) process with country fixed effects, embedding the following economic relationships:

1. **Taylor Rule**: Interest rates respond positively to lagged inflation (+0.20)
2. **Okun's Law**: Unemployment responds negatively to lagged GDP growth (-0.25)
3. **Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP)**: Exchange rate responds to interest rate differentials (+0.10)
4. **IS Curve**: GDP growth responds negatively to lagged interest rates (-0.15)
5. **Phillips Curve**: Inflation responds positively to lagged GDP growth (+0.10)

## Country List

The 30 countries represent a mix of developed and emerging economies:
USA, GBR, DEU, FRA, JPN, CAN, AUS, ITA, ESP, NLD, CHE, SWE, NOR, DNK, BEL,
AUT, FIN, IRL, PRT, GRC, BRA, MEX, IND, CHN, KOR, ZAF, TUR, POL, CZE, HUN.

## Data Generation

Generated using `utils/data_generators.py::generate_macro_panel()`.
See `00_ESTRUTURA.md` Section 2.2 for complete DGP details.

## Usage Example

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('../data/macro_panel.csv')
print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")
print(f"Countries: {df['country'].nunique()}")
print(f"Quarters: {df['quarter'].nunique()}")
```
