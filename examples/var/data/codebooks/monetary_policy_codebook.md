# Monetary Policy Panel — Codebook

## Overview
- **Source**: Synthetic data generated by PanelBox (inspired by OECD Main Economic Indicators)
- **Panel dimensions**: N = 25 OECD countries, T = 80 quarters
- **Time coverage**: 2000-Q1 to 2019-Q4
- **Total observations**: 2,000

## Variables

| Variable | Type | Unit | Description | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------------|-------|
| country | str | — | OECD country name | Primary key (with quarter). 25 OECD members. |
| quarter | str | — | Quarter in "YYYY-QN" format | Primary key (with country). 80 quarters. |
| gdp_growth | float | % annualized | Real GDP growth rate | mean ≈ 2.0, std ≈ 2.0. Includes crisis dip. |
| inflation | float | % annualized | CPI inflation rate | mean ≈ 2.5, std ≈ 1.5. Below-target post-crisis. |
| interest_rate | float | % | Policy interest rate | mean ≈ 3.0, std ≈ 2.0, ≥ 0. Zero lower bound binds 2009-2015. |
| unemployment | float | % | Unemployment rate | mean ≈ 7.5, std ≈ 3.5, ≥ 0. Spikes during crisis. |

## Key Features

### Structural Break (2008 Global Financial Crisis)

This dataset includes a structural break around 2008-Q3:
- **Pre-crisis (2000-Q1 to 2008-Q2)**: Normal economic dynamics with active Taylor rule responses. Higher interest rates, stable growth.
- **Crisis shock (2008-Q3)**: Large negative GDP shock (~3 standard deviations), reflecting the financial crisis.
- **Post-crisis (2008-Q3 to 2019-Q4)**: Lower persistence, reduced policy rates, zero lower bound binding for several countries.

### Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)

Interest rates are constrained to be non-negative (≥ 0). For the first 10 countries in the sample, the ZLB binds more aggressively during 2009-2015, reflecting the experience of major OECD economies.

### Monetary Policy Transmission

The DGP embeds standard monetary transmission channels:
1. **Interest rate → GDP**: Contractionary monetary policy reduces output with a lag
2. **Interest rate → Inflation**: Higher rates reduce inflation (with longer lags)
3. **Inflation → Interest rate**: Taylor rule — central banks respond to inflation
4. **GDP → Unemployment**: Okun's law relationship

## Country List

25 OECD countries: USA, GBR, DEU, FRA, JPN, CAN, AUS, ITA, ESP, NLD, CHE,
SWE, NOR, DNK, BEL, AUT, FIN, IRL, PRT, GRC, KOR, MEX, POL, CZE, HUN.

## Data Generation

Generated using `utils/data_generators.py::generate_monetary_policy_panel()`.
See `00_ESTRUTURA.md` Section 2.5 for complete DGP details.

## Usage in Case Study (Notebook 07)

This dataset is designed for the capstone case study on monetary policy transmission. It allows students to:
- Estimate Panel VARs with structural breaks
- Compare pre-crisis vs post-crisis monetary transmission
- Analyze the effects of the zero lower bound
- Evaluate heterogeneous policy responses across countries

## Usage Example

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('../data/monetary_policy.csv')
print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")

# Split pre/post crisis
pre_crisis = df[df['quarter'] < '2008-Q3']
post_crisis = df[df['quarter'] >= '2008-Q3']
print(f"Pre-crisis: {pre_crisis.shape[0]} obs")
print(f"Post-crisis: {post_crisis.shape[0]} obs")
```
