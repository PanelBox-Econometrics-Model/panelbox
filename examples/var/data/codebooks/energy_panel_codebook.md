# Energy Panel — Codebook

## Overview
- **Source**: Synthetic data generated by PanelBox (inspired by IEA Energy Prices and Taxes)
- **Panel dimensions**: N = 25 countries, T = 60 quarters
- **Time coverage**: 2005-Q1 to 2019-Q4
- **Total observations**: 1,500

## Variables

| Variable | Type | Unit | Description | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------------|-------|
| country | str | — | Country ISO-3 code | Primary key (with quarter) |
| quarter | str | — | Quarter in "YYYY-QN" format | Primary key (with country) |
| oil_price | float | log($/barrel) | Log of Brent crude oil price | mean ≈ 4.0, std ≈ 0.4. Upstream energy source. |
| gas_price | float | log($/MMBtu) | Log of natural gas price | mean ≈ 1.5, std ≈ 0.5. Intermediate in transmission chain. |
| electricity_price | float | log(index) | Log of electricity price index | mean ≈ 4.5, std ≈ 0.3. Downstream energy product. |

## Economic Relationships (DGP)

The data is generated from a VAR(1) process modeling the energy price transmission chain:

1. **Oil → Gas**: Strong upstream-to-downstream transmission (+0.30). Oil prices drive natural gas prices with a lag.
2. **Gas → Electricity**: Downstream transmission (+0.25). Gas prices affect electricity generation costs.
3. **Oil → Electricity**: Direct but weaker transmission (+0.10). Some electricity is generated from oil.
4. **Oil exogeneity**: Oil prices have the highest persistence (0.70) and are primarily driven by global shocks.

**Note**: All prices are in natural logarithm form. To recover levels, use `np.exp(value)`.

## Country List

25 countries: USA, GBR, DEU, FRA, JPN, CAN, AUS, ITA, ESP, NLD, CHE, SWE,
NOR, DNK, BEL, AUT, FIN, IRL, PRT, GRC, BRA, MEX, IND, CHN, KOR.

## Data Generation

Generated using `utils/data_generators.py::generate_energy_panel()`.
See `00_ESTRUTURA.md` Section 2.3 for complete DGP details.

## Usage Example

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('../data/energy_panel.csv')
print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")
print(df.describe())
```
